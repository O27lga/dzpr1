 <h3> <p><dfn>Hypertext Markup Language <u>(HTML)</u> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p></h3></dfn>
 <h3> <p>Web browsers receive <u>HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <u>HTML</u> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p></h3>
 <h4><p><dfn><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < img />
 and<  input   /  > directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

<h5><p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like '< u >< /h1 > and < /h1></u >', although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p><h5>
<h3> <p><code>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</code></p></h3>
 <h2><p><div><center>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:<p>
