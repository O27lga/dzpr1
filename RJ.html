  <b>ACT 1</b><br>
  <b>Prologue</b><br>
  <p> Two households,both alike in dignity.<br>
    In fair Verona,where we lay our scence.<br>
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny.<br>
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
    From forth the fatal Ioins of thease two foes.<br>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life.<br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
    Do with their death bury their parents strife.<br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
    And the continuance of their parents rage,
    Which,but their children's end ,nought could remove,<br>
    Is now the two hour's traffic of our stage.<br>
    The which if you with patient ears attend<br>
    What here shall miss,our toil shall strive to mend<br>
    <b>SCENE I.Verona.A public place.</b><br>
    Enter Samson and Grerory,of the house of Copulet armed with swards and buckers.<br>
    <b>SAMPSON</b><br>
    Gregory,o'my word we'll not carry coals.<br>
    GREGORY<br>
    No,for then we should be colliers.<br>
